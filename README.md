# Welcom to HeartDisease Dataset
Classification project on heart disease datasets. I use data undersampling with some modeling such as Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression. Finally, reveal some of the factors that trigger heart disease.

# About Dataset
According to the https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/risk_factors.htm, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US (African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and white people). About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.

# Project Objective
To prove what factors influence heart disease in adults in this dataset. This project will be updated to be able to predict whether someone has the potential to have heart disease or not?
